## Exercise 1

Let $Y_1, \ldots Y_n | \theta$ be an i.i.d. random sample from a population with pdf $p(y|\theta)$ where 

$$
p(y|\theta) = \frac{2}{\Gamma(a)} \theta^{2a} y^{2a -1} e^{-\theta^2 y^2}
$$

and $y > 0$, $\theta > 0$, $a > 0$.

For this density, 

$$
\begin{aligned}
E~Y|\theta &= \frac{\Gamma(a + \frac{1}{2})}{\theta \Gamma(a)}\\
E~Y^2|\theta &= \frac{a}{\theta^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Call this density $g^2$ such that $Y_1, \ldots Y_n | \theta \sim g^2(a, \theta)$.

a. Find the joint pdf of $Y_1, \ldots Y_n | \theta$ and simplify as much as possible.

b. Suppose $a$ is known but $\theta$ is unknown. Identify a simple conjugate class of priors for $\theta$. For any arbitrary member of the class, identify the posterior density $p(\theta | y_1, \ldots y_n)$.

c. Obtain a formula for $E~ \theta | Y_1, \ldots Y_n$ and $Var~\theta | Y_1, \ldots Y_n$ when the prior is in the conjugate class.

## Exercise 2


Handwritten digit classification.
Data originally sourced from U.S. postal envelopes.

Exercise inspired by [Prof. Hua Zhou's](https://hua-zhou.github.io) Biostat M280.

In this exercise, you will build a very simple Bayesian image classifier. Load the training and test data sets using the code below.

```{r}
#| eval: false
yTrain = readr::read_csv(
  "https://sta602-sp25.github.io/data/hw-digits-train.csv")

yTest = readr::read_csv(
  "https://sta602-sp25.github.io/data/hw-digits-test.csv"
)
```

The training data set contains 3822 images like the ones displayed above. 
Each image is a 32 x 32 bitmap, i.e. 1024 pixels, where each pixel is either black (0) or white (1). 
The 1024 pixels are divided into 64 blocks of 4 x 4 pixels. 
Each digit in the data set is represented by a vector of these blocks $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, \ldots, x_{64})$ where each element is a count of the white pixels in a block (a number between 0 and 16).

The 65th column of the data set (`id`) is the actual digit label. 

a. How many of each digit are in the training data set? Create a histogram to show the distribution of `block10` white pixels for each digit. What do you notice?

b. Assume each digit (i.e. each `id`) has its own multinomial data generative model. You can read about the multinomial distribution using `?rmultinom` in R. 

  - Write down the joint density for images with id "j", $\prod_{k = 1}^{n_j} p(\mathbf{x}_k^{(j)} | \boldsymbol{\pi}^{(j)})$. Here $n_j$ is the number of images of type $j$ and $\boldsymbol{\pi}^{(j)} = \{\pi_1^{(j)}, \ldots, \pi_{64}^{(j)} \}$

  - How many total unknown parameters are in the complete joint density of all images?
  
::: callout-note
Notice that the multinomial sampling model places positive density on $x_i > 16$, which is impossible in our data. This model is overly simple.

c. The Dirichlet distribution is the multivariate generalization of the beta distribution. You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution).  Place a Dirichlet prior on the probability parameters for each of your multinomial models in part b. Let the  concentration parameters be all identically 1.

  - Compute the posterior mean $\hat{\boldsymbol{\pi}}^{(j)}$ for each $j$ (or approximate it with Monte Carlo sampling). Hint: you may need to look up how to sample from a Dirichlet distribution in R. You may do this manually or find a package with built-in functions.

d. For each image $\mathbf{x}$ in your testing data set, compute your predicted id according to $\text{argmax}_{j}~~p(\mathbf{x}| \boldsymbol{\hat{\pi}}^{(j)})p(j)$, where $p(j)$ is the proportion of digit $j$ in the training set. Report the number of correct and incorrect classifications in your testing data set.

<!-- Physicists studying a radioactive substance measure the times at which the substance emits a particle. They will record $n+1$ emissions and set $Y_1$ to be the time elapsed between the first and second emission, $Y_2$ to be the time elapsed between the second and third emission and so on. They will model the data as $Y_1, \ldots Y_n | \theta \sim \text{i.i.d. } \text{exponential}(\theta)$. The pdf of the exponential($\theta$) distribution is  -->

<!-- $$ -->
<!-- p(y |\theta) = \theta e^{-\theta y} \ \text{ for } \ y>0, \ \theta>0. -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- For this distribution, $E[Y|\theta] = \frac{1}{\theta}$. -->

<!-- (a). Write out the corresponding joint density $p(y_1, \ldots, y_n | \theta)$ and simplify as much as possible. Justify each step of your calculation. -->

<!-- (b). Compute the maximum likelihood estimate $\hat{\theta}_{MLE}$, i.e. the value $\hat{\theta}_{MLE}$ that maximizes $p(y_1,\ldots y_n | \theta)$. Hint: it's easier to work with the log-likelihood. -->

<!-- (c). Choose a prior $p(\theta)$ that is conjugate to the likelihood. Hint: look at kernels of densities on the distribution sheet. Write out the formula for $p(\theta | y_1, \ldots y_n)$, up to a proportionality in $\theta$, and simplify as much as possible. From this, identify explicitly the posterior distribution of $\theta$ (i.e., write "the posterior is a blank distribution with parameter(s) blank)". -->

<!-- (d). Obtain the formula for $E[\theta | y_1, \ldots y_n]$ as a function of $a, b, n$ and $y_1, \ldots y_n$, and try to write this as a function of the estimator $\hat{\theta}$ you found in part (b). What does $E[\theta | y_1,\ldots,y_n]$ get close to as $n$ increases? -->

<!-- (e). Assume you observe $(y_1, \ldots, y_5) = (0.13, 0.31, 0.15, 0.12, 0.29)$ and let $\theta \sim \text{gamma}(1, 1)$. Report a 95\% posterior confidence interval for $\theta$. -->

## Exercise 3

Suppose $Y|\theta \sim \text{binary}(\theta)$ and we believe $\theta \sim \text{Uniform}(0, 1)$ describes our uninformed prior beliefs about $\theta$. However, we are really interested in the log-odds $\gamma = f(\theta) = \log \frac{\theta}{1 - \theta}$.

a. Find the prior distribution for $\gamma$ induced by our prior on $\theta$. Is the prior informative about $\gamma$? Verify $p(\gamma)$ using Monte Carlo sampling (i.e. sampling from $p(\theta)$) and then plotting the empirical density of the transformed samples along with the closed-form solution.

b. **In general**, is the mean of the transform the same as the transform of the mean? In other words, is $E f(\theta) = f(E[\theta])$? Why or why not? Hint: come up with another example.

c. Assume some data come in and $\sum y_i = 7$ out of $n = 10$ trials. Report the posterior mean and 95% posterior confidence interval for $\gamma$. Is the transform of the quantile the quantile of the transform? Why or why not?
