## Exercise 1

Let $X_i \in \mathcal{X}$ for all $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots\}$ and suppose our belief model for $\mathbf{X} = \{ X_1, \ldots X_n \}$ is exchangeable for all $n$. Show, using de Finetti's theorem, that for all $i \neq j$,

$$
Cov(X_i, X_j) \geq 0 \text{ and }
$$

$$
Corr(X_i, X_j) \geq 0.
$$

## Exercise 2

Let $X, Y, Z$ be random variables with joint density (discrete or continuous) 

$$
p(x, y, z) \propto f(x,z) g(y, z) h(z).
$$

Show that 

a. $p(x | y, z) \propto f(x, z)$, i.e. $p(x | y, z)$ is a function of $x$ and $z$. 
b. $p(y | x, z) \propto g(y, z)$, i.e. $p(y | x, z)$ is a function of $y$ and $z$.
c. $X$ and $Y$ are conditionally independent given $Z$.

## Exercise 3

The number of particles $Y$ emitted from a rock sample depends on the unknown amount $\theta$ of the sample that is radioactive. For each possible value of $\theta$,

$$
Pr(Y = y | \theta) = \theta^y e^{-\theta} / y!
$$
for each $y \in \{0, 1, 2, \ldots \}$. Suppose it is known that the rock is one of three possible types $A$, $B$, or $C$, each with a particular value of $\theta$, that is, $\theta \in \{\theta_A, \theta_B, \theta_C \}$ where $\theta_A = 1.1$, $\theta_B = 3.2$, and $\theta_C = 4.5$.

a. Make a graph of $Pr(Y = y | \theta)$ as a function of $y$ for each of the three possible values of $\theta$ (for some reasonable range of $y$-values.

b. Now suppose that the rock is of type $A$, $B$, or $C$ with probabilities $.4$, $.3$ and $.3$ respectively. Compute the *marginal* probability of $Y$, that is,  
$Pr(Y = y) = Pr(Y = y | \theta_A) Pr(\text{type} = A) + Pr(Y = y | \theta_B) Pr(\text{type} = B) + Pr(Y = y | \theta_C) Pr(\text{type} = C)$  
Plot this as a function of $y$ and compare the graph to the three graphs from part a.

c. Suppose it is observed that $Y = 4$. Using the rules of conditional probability, compute the probabilities of each type conditional on $Y = 4$, that is, compute $Pr(\theta = \theta_X | Y = 4)$ for each $X \in \{A, B, C \}$. Compare these probabilities to the prior probabilities (.4, .3, .3).


## Exercise 4

Let $Y_1, \ldots Y_n$ be binary random variables that are conditionally independent given a value of a parameter $\theta$, so that $Pr(Y_i = 1 | \theta) = \theta = 1 - Pr(Y_i = 0 | \theta)$.

a. Let $y_1, \ldots y_n$ be a binary sequence so that $y_i \in \{0, 1 \}$, for each $i = 1, \ldots, n$. Using the rules of probability, derive a formula for $Pr(Y_1 = y_1, \ldots, Y_n = y_n | \theta)$ as a function of $y_1, \ldots y_n$ and $\theta$. Simplify as much as possible.

b. Let $X = \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i$, what is the probability $p(X = x | \theta)$ for any $x \in \{0, 1, \ldots n\}$? Explain (in 1-2 sentences) why $n \choose y$ is in the expression.

c. Compute and compare, using the definition of expectation and variance: $E(Y_i|\theta)$, $Var(Y_i|\theta)$ to $E(X|\theta)$ and $Var(X|\theta)$. 

d. Using calculus or otherwise, for a given value of $x$, find "$\theta_{MLE}$", the value of $\theta$ that maximizes $Pr(X = x|\theta)$. This value is called the "maximum likelihood estimator" or MLE, of $\theta$.
