## Exercise 

Show that the Jeffreys prior for the normal model is $p_J(\theta, \sigma^2) \propto (\sigma^2)^{-3/2}$.

Note: our sampling model has *two unknowns*. Let $\Psi = (\theta, \sigma^2)$. Then $p_J(\Psi) \propto \sqrt{|I(\Psi)|}$ where $|I(\Psi)|$ is the determinant of the $2 \times 2$ Hessian matrix.
