## Beginnings

While this is not a computing class, computers are the workhorse of Bayesian statistics and we will use R to both enhance understanding of fundamental course material as well as to implement models to learn about real data sets.

## Set up RStudio

### Option 1 (easiest): RStudio container

- Go to [https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers](https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers) and login with your Duke NetID and Password.
- Click `RStudio` to log into the Docker container. You should now see the RStudio environment.

If you haven't previously done so, you will need to reserve a container for `RStudio` first.


## Set up RStudio

### Option 2: RStudio on your computer

- Download `R` from [http://www.r-project.org/](http://www.r-project.org/).

- Download RStudio, the popular IDE for R, from [https://posit.co/downloads/](https://posit.co/downloads/).

- (optionally) download Quarto from [https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

## Demo

Next, check your familarity with R/RStudio fundamentals [here](/labs/lab0.html). You can also find a link to this from the [course schedule](/index.html) under "Assignment".
