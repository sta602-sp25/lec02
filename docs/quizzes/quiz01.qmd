### Exercise 1

`TRUE` or `FALSE`: The beta prior is conjugate to a binomial likelihood.

### Exercise 2

In Bayes' theorem (written below), which term is the "normalizing constant"?

$$
p(\theta | y) = \frac{p(y |\theta) p(\theta)}{\int p(y, \theta) d\theta}
$$

### Exercise 3

$$
\begin{aligned}
X &\sim gamma(k, \theta)\\
p(x) &= \frac{1}{\Gamma(k) \theta^k}x^{k-1}e^{-x/\theta}
\end{aligned}
$$
Write down the kernel of the density (as a function of $x$).
