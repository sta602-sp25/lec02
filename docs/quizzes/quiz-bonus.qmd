To receive credit for this assignment, write your full name at the top of your paper.

Assume $Y| \theta \sim \text{Poisson}(\theta)$.

Match each exercise with solution choices (a), (b), or (c) below to provide the name of each of the following priors.

### Exercise 1

$$
\theta \sim \text{gamma}(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \bar{y})
$$

### Exercise 2

$$
\begin{aligned}
p(\theta) &\propto 1 \text{ if } \theta > 0\\
 &= 0 \text{ otherwise }
\end{aligned}
$$

### Exercise 3

$$
p(\theta) \propto \theta ^{-1/2}
$$


### Solution choices

- (a): Jeffreys prior

- (b): Improper uniform prior

- (c): Unit information prior
