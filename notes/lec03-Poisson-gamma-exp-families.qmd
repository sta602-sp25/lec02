## Data: Boston Celtics

In basketball, an "assist" is attributed to a player that passes the ball to a teammate in a way that directly leads to a basket. The data below was scraped from [espn.com]() September 2024. Each row of the data set is an individual Boston Celtics player during a particular game of the 2023-2024 season. The `AST` records the number of assists made by the player in the particular game. `MIN` records the number of minutes each player played in a particular game. `vs` records the opposing team.

**Question:** how many assists on average do we expect a Celtics player to make per minute played?

## Bayesian framework

1. Define a data generative model and write down the likelihood (often assuming exchangeability and invoking de Finetti's theorem)
2. Choose a prior distribution for all things unknown
3. Compute or approximate the posterior
4. Make inference

### Data-generative model 

To write down a data generative model, let's assume players accumulate assists $y$ at some per-minute rate, $\theta$. We will further assume that the expected number of assists by a player in a given game is then $\theta x$ where $x$ is the number of minutes played. 

Given $y$ takes integer values $\{0, 1, 2, \ldots \}$, a Poisson distribution might make sense. If $Y | \lambda$ is Poisson$(\lambda)$, then

$$
p(y |\lambda) = \frac{(\lambda)^y e^{-\lambda}}{y!}
$$

Here, $\lambda = \theta x$.

Assuming this conditionally independent model for generating $y$s, we write the likelihood,

$$
p(y_1,\ldots y_n | \theta) = \prod_{i = 1}^n \frac{(\theta x_i)^{y_i} e^{-\theta x_i}}{y_i!}
$$

::: panel-tabset
## Exercise 

What assumptions are we making about assists in the data generative model above?
:::

<!-- 
- All players accumulate assists at the same fundamental per-minute rate theta
- theta is constant across all players, across all games (e.g. no injuries etc)
-->

### Prior beliefs

- Notice the support: $\theta > 0$
- A gamma prior may be suitable

$$
\begin{aligned}
\theta &\sim gamma(a, b)\\
p(\theta | a, b) &= \frac{b^{a}}{\Gamma(a)} \theta^{a - 1} e^{-b \theta}
\end{aligned}
$$
### Compute the posterior

::: panel-tabset

## Exercise
Compute the posterior.

## Solution

$$
\begin{aligned}
\theta | y_1,\ldots y_n &\sim gamma(\alpha, \beta)\\
\alpha &= a + \sum_{i=1}^n y_i\\
\beta &= b + \sum_{i=1}^n x_i
\end{aligned}
$$

:::

Hint: we have conjugacy. You can see this if you view the likelihood and the prior each as a function of $\theta$, the kernel of each has the same functional form. 

Follow-up: 

1. what is $E[\theta | y_1,\ldots, y_n]$? How does it compare to $E[\theta]$?
2. what is $Var[\theta | y_1,\ldots y_n]$?

## plot posterior

#| echo: false
a = 9
b = 3
sumY = sum(yx$AST)
sumX = sum(yx$MIN)

data.frame(x = c(0, 0.5)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x)) + 
  stat_function(fun = dgamma, args = list(shape = sumY + a,
                                          rate = sumX + b)) + 
  labs(x = TeX("$\\theta$"), y = TeX("p($\\theta | y_1, \\ldots, y_n$)")) +
  theme_bw()

posteriorMean = (a + sumY) / (b + sumX)
```
## code

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
a = 9
b = 3
sumY = sum(yx$AST)
sumX = sum(yx$MIN)

data.frame(x = c(0, 0.5)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x)) + 
  stat_function(fun = dgamma, args = list(shape = sumY + a,
                                          rate = sumX + b)) + 
  labs(x = TeX("$\\theta$"), y = TeX("p($\\theta | y_1, \\ldots, y_n$)")) +
  theme_bw()
```

:::

Given our prior of $a = 9, b = 3$, $E[\theta | y_1,\ldots, y_n] =$ `r round(posteriorMean, digits = 4)`

## Exponential families 

**Definition**: a **sufficient statistic** is a function of the data $(y_1,\ldots y_n$) that is sufficient to make inference about unknown parameters ($\theta$).

If density $p(y|\theta)$ can be written $h(y) c(\phi) e^{\phi t(y)}$ for some transform $\phi = f(\theta)$ we can say $p(y|\theta)$ belongs in the exponential family.

::: callout-note
$t(y)$ is referred to as the *sufficient statistic*.
:::

If $p(y|\theta)$ belongs in the exponential family, then the conjugate prior is 
$$
p(\phi | n_0, t_0) = \kappa(n_0, t_0)c(\phi)^{n_0} e^{n_0 t_0 \phi},
$$
where $\kappa(n_0, t_0)$ is a normalizing constant. 

:::callout-note
## Notes about the prior

1. the conjugate prior is given over $\phi$ and we'd have to transform back if we care about $p(\theta)$.

2. $n_0$ is interpreted as the *prior sample size* and $t_0$ is the *prior guess*.
:::

The resulting posterior is 

$$
p(\phi | y_1,\ldots y_n) \propto p \left(\phi | n_0 + n, \frac{n_0 t_0 + n \sum t(y_i)/n}{n_0 + n}\right)
$$
In words, one can show that the kernel of the posterior of $\phi$ is proportional to the kernel of the prior of $\phi$ with specific parameters. Thereby, we have conjugacy.
